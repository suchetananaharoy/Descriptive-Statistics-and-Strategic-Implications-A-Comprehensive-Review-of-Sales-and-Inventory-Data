Time Series Forecasting:

Purpose: Predict future sales and inventory levels based on historical data.
Models:
ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average): Suitable for data with trends and seasonality. It combines autoregression, differencing, and moving averages to model time-dependent data.
SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA): Extends ARIMA by incorporating seasonality components, making it ideal for datasets with seasonal patterns.
Prophet: Developed by Facebook, this model handles missing data and outliers effectively, incorporating trends and seasonalities in time series forecasting.
Reinforcement Learning:

Purpose: Optimize inventory management by learning from interactions with the environment.
Models:
Q-Learning: A value-based method where an agent learns the value of actions in various states to maximize long-term rewards. It updates a Q-table based on experiences.
Deep Q-Networks (DQN): An extension of Q-learning that uses neural networks to approximate the Q-values, handling more complex state and action spaces.
Demand Estimation:

Purpose: Estimate future demand to optimize inventory levels and reduce stockouts.
Models:
Linear Regression: Models the relationship between demand and influencing factors like price and seasonality. Useful for understanding the impact of various predictors.
Machine Learning Regression Models: Includes algorithms like Random Forest and Gradient Boosting, which can capture non-linear relationships and interactions between features.
Inventory Optimization:
Purpose: Determine optimal inventory levels to balance costs and meet demand.
Models:
Economic Order Quantity (EOQ): Calculates the optimal order size that minimizes total inventory costs, including holding and ordering costs.
Safety Stock Calculation: Uses historical sales data and variability to determine buffer stock levels that prevent stockouts.



In the Result and Discussion section, we present a comprehensive analysis of the descriptive statistics derived from the historical sales, inventory levels, market trends, and supplier performance data. This analysis offers a critical understanding of key metrics such as mean, median, and standard deviation across different datasets. By examining these statistics, we gain valuable insights into the patterns and variances inherent in sales and inventory management, as well as the impact of market trends and supplier performance on overall business operations. The results highlight significant trends and anomalies, providing a foundation for informed decision-making. This discussion aims to interpret these findings, assess their implications, and suggest actionable strategies to enhance operational efficiency and strategic planning.
